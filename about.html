<p>
    I am a Software Engineer at Farad.ai where I develop tools for power systems
    modelling and network digitisation.
</p>

<p>
    My experience with coding started in my last few years of school when
    my curiosity in robots led me to getting an Arduino Uno and playing
    around with flashing LEDs and some really fiddly buttons.
</p>

<p>
    Since then I pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated
    from the University of Southampton in 2017. While there I did a whole
    lot more to do with Arduinos, but also discovered Raspberry Pi's, MATLAB,
    Python and C.
</p>

<p>
    After graduating, I accepted a job offer in EDF's UK R&D
    team with the chance to pursue an MSc in Scientific Computing, which
    I completed in 2020. I now apply the skills and experience I have gained
    over the last few years for tackling new business and technological
    challenges - all while having little side projects to satisfy any
    remaining curiosity.

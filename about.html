<h1>About</h1>


<p>
    I am research analyst currently doing a part-time postgraduate
    degree in Scientific Computing at UCL. I started this site to
    collect in a nicely formatted way different things I learn and
    do with regards to coding, computational science, and other
    engineering things.
</p>

<p>
    My experience with coding started in my last few years of school when
    my curiosity in robots led me to getting an Arduino Uno and playing
    around with flashing LEDs and some really fiddly buttons.
</p>

<p>
    Since then I pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated
    from the University of Southampton in 2017. While there I did a whole
    lot more to do with Arduinos, but also discovered Raspberry Pi's, MATLAB,
    Python and C.
</p>

<p>
    After graduating in 2017, I accepted a job offer in EDF Energy's R&D
    team with the chance to study part-time. And here I am, today!

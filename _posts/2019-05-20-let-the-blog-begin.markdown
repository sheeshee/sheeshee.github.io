Hello! This is my first offical blog post. There have been lots
of different projects I've been meaning to persue for a while.
This little blog is going to be a way for me to record the different
projects I complete over time. I also want to create little collections
of learning ressources for various topics.

In fact, my first post is going to be a collection of links and other
ressources for learning Git!

The layout of this blog will surely progress over time. At the moment
I'm not very happy with the layout, but I do not know enough about Jekyll
to change it too much - though to be honest, I still don't know 
exactly what I want either in this regard...

Time to get to work!

I am research analyst currently doing a part-time postgraduate degree in Scientific Computing at UCL. I started this site to collect in a nicely formatted way different things I learn with regards to coding and computational stuff!

My experience with coding started in my last few years of school when my curiosity in robots led me to getting an Arduino Uno and playing around with flashing LEDs and some really fiddley buttons.

Since then I pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering and graduated from the Univeristy of Southampton in 2017. While there I did a whole lot more to do with Arduinos, but also discovered Raspberry Pi's, MATLAB, Python and C.

After graduating in 2017, I was offered a job in EDF Energy's R&D team with the chance to study part-time. And here I am, today!

Hopefully, you'll find this collection of information useful!

Happy Coding :balloon:

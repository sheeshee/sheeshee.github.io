The Jupyter extension nbconvert allows users to export their notebooks as PDFs,
slides, html documents, etc... and it is easy enough to create your own
templates to use locally. On the other hand there was no clear documentation
for publishing one's own templates online and distributing them through
pypi.org. This project serves as a minimal example of how one can accomplish
this.

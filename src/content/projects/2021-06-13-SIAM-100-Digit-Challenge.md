The SIAM 100 Digit Challenge was a series of short yet very difficult problem
statements first published in 2002 asking participants to calculate the numerical
solution to various mathematical problems as accurately as possible. They seem
like good ways to keep up my skills in my Scientific Computing degree, so I
created a GitHub repo to record my solutions.

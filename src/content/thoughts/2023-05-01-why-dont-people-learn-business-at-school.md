Now that you're grown up and looking for how to maximize your income, have you thought about running your own business? The thought crosses my mind now and then, but the idea of running a business is so intangible to me, I have a hard time figuring out how to move forward with it.

Part of me wishes I learnt this when at school. Wouldn't it be great if schools kids entrepreneurship?

Schools are meant to prepare children to be productive members of society. The argument being that the cost they incur is worth the eventual payoff through the wealth the average student will produce.

From this perspective, it doesn't necessarily make sense to explicitly teach kids how to be entrepreneurial. The least they need to know is how to be a useful employee.

In many ways, this is exactly the same as it was way back when. Society needs workers to do it's tasks. It doesn't need people to constantly be looking out how to make a better business deal.

But what if it did? Surely, citizens who fully understand implications of business and a free market would naturally lead to a more efficient economy?

Either way, if a parent wants their kids to be best prepared for the world, it is in their interest to get them used to the idea of taking calculated risks and experimenting with ideas to create solid value propositions.

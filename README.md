# Sam's Notes #

This is an ongoing project for me with two principal objectives:
	* to collect learning ressources I find on various topics in one place; and
	* to document my own projects and create an online portfolio demonstrating my skills


## Objective 1: Be a starting point for X ##

There are already wonderful and well written ressources out there for almost every topic, so the main function of this repo is to collect these together according to theme.

The topics I plan on investigating will be (in vaguely this order):

1. How to use Git and GitHub
2. How to use Python (w/ Work Environment Setup, Object-Oriented Design, Package Architecture and Python Debugger)
3. How to use R (w/ Work Environment Setup, Packages, Debugger, other R things)
4. How to use MATLAB (w/ Work Environment Setup)
5. How to make Code Faster (w/ unit testing)
6. How to work with Data (w/ APIs and Databases)
7. How to use Machine Learning, out of the box
8. How to develop and build a simulation/model

## Objective 2: Be an online portfolio ##

Each project I work in should have its own page explaining the initial problem, how I solved it and the ressources I used to do so.

It should then link to my corresponding code repository and list other interesting ressources.

Projects on my to-do list at the moment are the following:
1. Cryptopals - As far as I can go!
2. Kaggle's Digit Recognition (and other Kaggle challenges)
3. My Smart Home Assistant
4. Robotic Claw with Computer Vision
5. Musical Tesla Coil

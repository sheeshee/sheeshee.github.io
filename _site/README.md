# Code Better #

This is an ongoing project for me to go through the excercise of pursuing, organising and recording new knowledge and ressources I gather for the various topics I find interesting - topics specifically related to writing code and developing software projects. 

There are already wonderful and well written ressources out there for almost every topic, so the main function of this repo is to collect these together according to theme.

The topics I plan on investigating will be (in vaguely this order):

1. How to use Git and GitHub
2. How to use Python (w/ Work Environment Setup, Object-Oriented Design, Package Architecture and Python Debugger)
3. How to use R (w/ Work Environment Setup, Packages, Debugger, other R things)
4. How to use MATLAB (w/ Work Environment Setup)
5. How to make Code Faster (w/ unit testing)
6. How to work with Data (w/ APIs and Databases)
7. How to use Machine Learning, out of the box
8. How to develop and build a simulation/model

Here are the topics I'm interested in (with a bit more detail)
